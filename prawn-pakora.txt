Ingredients:
- 2 green chillies
- 3 garlic cloves, peeled
- 3cm piece ginger, peeled
- juice from 1 lemon
- 350g raw king prawns
- 150g gram flour
- ½ tsp sea salt
- ½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
- ½ tsp ground turmeric
- ½ tsp cumin seeds
- ½ tsp coriander seeds, crushed
- ½ tsp garam masala
- small handful coriander, finely chopped
- approx. 100ml warm water
- avocado oil, for deep-frying

Directions:
1. In a blender blitz ginger, garlic, chillies and empty into a bowl.

2. Add the salt, turmeric, chilli powder and lemon juice and stir through the prawns – leave these to marinate for 30 minutes.

3. Heat oil in a karahi for deep frying

4. In a second bowl, sift in the gram flour and add the crushed coriander seeds, garam masala and cumin seeds.

5. Add the prawn mixture and mix to coat with the batter. If it feels dry add in a little water to create a thick batter.

6. Check the oil is hot enough by dropping in a little batter. If it rises straight away, it's ready.

7. Very carefully slip a few of the prawns into the hot oil to fry for three to four minutes. Turn them over and when they're golden brown all over remove them with a slotted spoon.

8. Drain on a baking tray lined with kitchen paper and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining. Serve immediately while they're still hot.
